# Debugging JavaScript

This project contains a few examples of debugging in JavaScript (in Node.js and in the browser).


## Requirements

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)


## Get the Code

Download the code for this project by using git clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gregmercer/debug.git
```
This will create a new directory (folder) on your computer.


## Install Node Modules

Like any node project, you will need to download and install the required node modules for the project to run. This is done by running `npm install` in your terminal window while inside the project directory. Change into the project directory with the following command:
```bash
cd debug
```

Now you can run the install:
```bash
npm install
```


## Start the App

Once the install has finished, you can run the project like this:
```bash
npm start
```

You should see the following if everything is OK:
```
Server started and listening at localhost:3000
```


## Try the Demo

Open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see a simple search form. Try to search for something like "web" or "javascript". The data being searched is in the server.js file.


Try to fix the problem, then restart the app.
